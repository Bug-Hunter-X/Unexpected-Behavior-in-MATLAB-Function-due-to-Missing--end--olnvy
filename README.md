This repository contains a MATLAB function exhibiting unexpected behavior. The function, 'myFunction.m', is designed to perform calculations based on the input value; however, a missing 'end' keyword in the if-elseif-else block leads to incorrect results in certain cases. The solution, 'bugSolution.m', shows the corrected code with the added 'end' keyword. The example demonstrates the buggy behaviour and its correction.
